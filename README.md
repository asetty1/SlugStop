## 176 Project 3

For our project, we focused on the UCSC bus system, a critical aspect of student life. These buses are essential for getting to class, work, downtown, and more. This inspired the main mechanic of our game, where the protagonist, a banana slug, navigates a series of vertically scrolling buses to reach their destination. In this fast-paced, time-sensitive game, players must jump on and off the correct buses with precision. Missing the target destination results in a lossâ€”much like missing an important class section (like CMPM 176). Earn points by successfully reaching your stops within the time limit, and chain together combos to achieve the highest score!
